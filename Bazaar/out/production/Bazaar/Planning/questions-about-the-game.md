# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** CEO of Bazaar.com  
**FROM:** Mellow Chameleons!!!! (Ryan Tsai and Eric Sun)  
**DATE:** September 12, 2024  
**SUBJECT:** Questions about the Game

### Questions
1. How to decide which player goes first?
2. Can a player exchange pebbles with the equations an unlimited number of times in one turn? And if so, if within the available equations, there is some loop that allows the player to exchange pebbles indefinitely in one turn until the bank runs out of pebbles, is this allowed?
3. For "the referee removes the bottom-most card from the pile of invisible ones", does invisible ones refer to the pile of cards that are face down/fresh?
